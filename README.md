# hello-world
Breaking out of my **rut** and finding new source material to make more...my first repository.
Looking to switch careers like many others but there are **so many things** I am interested
in it is very hard to focus on one.  I am *currently* working on **Google Data Analytics Certificate**
on Coursera.  I am enjoying it so far.  Looking forward to collaborating some time in the future.
